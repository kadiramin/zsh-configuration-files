# zsh-configuration-files

A lightweight Zsh configuration that avoids the overhead of Oh My Zsh.
All necessary initializations for the prompt and fuzzy finder are already included in the provided configuration files. To get started, you only need to install the following dependencies via Homebrew.

## Prerequisites
1. Install Homebrew

Ensure that the Homebrew package manager is installed on your system. If it’s not, follow the instructions on Homebrew’s website
 to install it.

2. Install Required Packages

Use Homebrew to install the tools required for this configuration to function correctly:

- starship: Cross-shell prompt engine.

- fzf: Fuzzy finder for command history and file searches.

Run this command to install both packages:

```
brew install starship fzf
```
Installation
1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository directly to your home directory:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/zsh-configuration-files.git ~/
```

2. Copy the Configuration Files

Once the repository is cloned, copy the configuration files to your home directory. The .zshrc file is already set up to source these tools automatically on startup.
